            <p>I’ve always known how to do hair but never took it seriously until I started college. 
                That’s when I realized how important and meaningful this skill was. 
                I began doing all kinds of styles, including men’s hair, and my journey has been amazing.
                I’ve made a lot of progress, especially with improving my speed and timing while braiding, 
                which is one of the hardest parts. These images showcase some of my favorite styles I’ve done so far.
                 My journey has taught me so much, and I’ve even helped many people at Syracuse University learn how to braid.</p>

            <p>The World Gallery celebrates the global influence of hair artistry, 
                with Africa as the foundation where hand-braiding techniques first began, 
                shaping styles we see today. From intricate Asian hairstyles to elegant Middle Eastern braids and waves,
                 each region brings its own cultural touch. The Caribbean adds vibrant twists and locs, 
                 while European influence highlights creativity through wigs, bold colors, and modern trends. Together, 
                 these styles showcase the diversity, beauty, and creativity that unite us all through the art of hair.</p>
