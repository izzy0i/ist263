        <p> 
            I'm an Information Management and Technology major, and I love and enjoy coding. I'm currently trying to find a concentration, but it has been good so far.
            I don't really have any accomplishments regarding coding, but in high school, I did make a website and gained a certificate from it.
            I'm a <strong>hairstylist</strong>, an artist (painter), and love to do crafts. My favorite TV show is <em>The Parkers</em>. My favorite movie is <em>The Princess and the Frog</em>. I'm the eldest of 3 kids. I love creativity and I have many talents.
            I'm here to win and gain experience.
        </p>
